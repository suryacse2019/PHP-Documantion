Working with Operators:-
************************
The PHP Supports Two versions of Operators

1. Legacy Operators 5.x Version.
	1. are re kaun log special bit assign karengey
	
	1. Arthematic Operator :  Used to perform Mathematical Operations.
		1. +,-,*,/,%
			Arthematic Operators are classified into two category
			1. Unary Operators : 
			2. Binary Operators :
			
			Expression  Evaluate  = 1 Operator + Operands
			
			1. Operand : Varaibles, constants Participating in mathematical Exprssion(Operations) is called Operands.
				
				Eg : $x+$y 
					  |  |--->varaible (Operands)
					  varaible
						(Operands)
						
					  20+10 (Operands)
					   |  |constants
					   constants
					   (Operands)
					   
			2. Operator : symbol B/w two Operands, with unique Property of Mathematical
				solution is called as Operators.
					
					Eg:-
					Add 2 and 2 = [_4_] ||||
					2 + 2 =[4]
					
				
			3. Expression : n of Operands, seperated By logical Arrangement of Operators.
				Eg : /2+2 =Expression Invalid
				Eg : +2/2 = Valid Expression
				
			4. Solution : The Result after Evaluating or Simplifying the  		Expression is called as Solution.
			
			Unary : Operators that can Bring the change in the value by prefexing
			at the starting position.
			
			2 : 2>0 2 is a +ve Numbers : unsigned Integer
		   -2 : 2<0 -2 is a negative Integer :signed Integer
		   
		   total Size Occupied By Int : 2 Bytes
		   [+ or -][Number]
			1 Byte  1 Byte
		   [\][&][c][o][p][y][;][]
		   I18N
		  		
			Note ::
			In case of Division, 
				Division it is divided into 2 types
				1. float division (Complete Division)
				2. int division (Partial Division)
				
				Complete Division, Dynamically Typed Langauge
				Partial Division, Strict type langauge
				
				Eg:-
				Dividend = divisor * Q + Rem (%)
				Div - (divisor*Q) = Rem (%)
				
				If the langauge is strict Type
				Other wise it will divide completely.
				
				Formula of Division.
				********************
				
				1) int/int = int
				2) float/float = float
				3) float/int = float
				4) int/float = float
				
				Q*(r/d) = D/d
				
				
				What is Way
				***************
				1.  using Typecasting : intval().
				2.  using sprintf().
				3.  using flooring concept.
				
				
				1. What is intval() ?
				************************
				it is predefined function, typecasting
				or convert one type of value to the integer value.
				
				2. What is this sprintf() :
				*****************************
					sprintf stands for, string printf: it will return 
					the output generated by printf. instead of printing
					you can hold it in any variable.
					
				
				3. using flooring concept:
				In Mathematics, computations (calculation).
				There is a concept of floor() and ceil()
				
				Floor : floor() : it returns the lowest Integer by removing the decimal Point.
				
				ceiling fan : ceil()
				
				ceil : it returns, the Incremented
				value of lowest Integer.
				or
				it truncates, the value of decimal part
				and return a incremented value of lower
				integer.
				
				
				Eg:
				2.4 ---> 2 ---> Lowest Integer
				floor(2.4) ---> 2 + 1 ---> 3 ---> Ciel
				
				ceil() = floor(n) + 1 where n is floating.
				
				
				Note :: when the number is floating
				point then only floor and ceil will
				work.
				
				
				
Note the difference B/w ceil, floor, round
