Working with Operators:-
************************
The PHP Supports Two versions of Operators

1. Legacy Operators 5.x Version.
	1. are re kaun log special bit assign karengey
	
	1. Arthematic Operator :  Used to perform Mathematical Operations.
		1. +,-,*,/,%
			Arthematic Operators are classified into two category
			1. Unary Operators : 
			2. Binary Operators :
			
			Expression  Evaluate  = 1 Operator + Operands
			
			1. Operand : Varaibles, constants Participating in mathematical Exprssion(Operations) is called Operands.
				
				Eg : $x+$y 
					  |  |--->varaible (Operands)
					  varaible
						(Operands)
						
					  20+10 (Operands)
					   |  |constants
					   constants
					   (Operands)
					   
			2. Operator : symbol B/w two Operands, with unique Property of Mathematical
				solution is called as Operators.
					
					Eg:-
					Add 2 and 2 = [_4_] ||||
					2 + 2 =[4]
					
				
			3. Expression : n of Operands, seperated By logical Arrangement of Operators.
				Eg : /2+2 =Expression Invalid
				Eg : +2/2 = Valid Expression
				
			4. Solution : The Result after Evaluating or Simplifying the  		Expression is called as Solution.
			
			Unary : Operators that can Bring the change in the value by prefexing
			at the starting position.
			
			2 : 2>0 2 is a +ve Numbers : unsigned Integer
		   -2 : 2<0 -2 is a negative Integer :signed Integer
		   
		   total Size Occupied By Int : 2 Bytes
		   [+ or -][Number]
			1 Byte  1 Byte
		   [\][&][c][o][p][y][;][]
		   I18N
		  		
			Note ::
			In case of Division, 
				Division it is divided into 2 types
				1. float division (Complete Division)
				2. int division (Partial Division)
				
				Complete Division, Dynamically Typed Langauge
				Partial Division, Strict type langauge
				
				Eg:-
				Dividend = divisor * Q + Rem (%)
				Div - (divisor*Q) = Rem (%)
				
				If the langauge is strict Type
				Other wise it will divide completely.
				
				Formula of Division.
				********************
				
				1) int/int = int
				2) float/float = float
				3) float/int = float
				4) int/float = float
				
				Q*(r/d) = D/d
				
				
				What is Way
				***************
				1.  using Typecasting : intval().
				2.  using sprintf().
				3.  using flooring concept.
				
				
				1. What is intval() ?
				************************
				it is predefined function, typecasting
				or convert one type of value to the integer value.
				
				2. What is this sprintf() :
				*****************************
					sprintf stands for, string printf: it will return 
					the output generated by printf. instead of printing
					you can hold it in any variable.
					
				
				3. using flooring concept:
				In Mathematics, computations (calculation).
				There is a concept of floor() and ceil()
				
				Floor : floor() : it returns the lowest Integer by removing the decimal Point.
				
				ceiling fan : ceil()
				
				ceil : it returns, the Incremented
				value of lowest Integer.
				or
				it truncates, the value of decimal part
				and return a incremented value of lower
				integer.
				
				
				Eg:
				2.4 ---> 2 ---> Lowest Integer
				floor(2.4) ---> 2 + 1 ---> 3 ---> Ciel
				
				ceil() = floor(n) + 1 where n is floating.
				
				
				Note :: when the number is floating
				point then only floor and ceil will
				work.
				
				
				
Note the difference B/w ceil, floor, round
php > echo round(2.5);
3
php > echo round(2.5);
3
php > echo round(2.4);
2
php > echo ceil(2.4);
3
php > echo ceil(2.5);

php >      
				
	
	2. Relational Operator.
	3. conditional Operator.
	4. logical Operator.
	5. special Operator.
	6. Bitwise Operator.
	7. Assignment Operator.
	
2. Modern Operators 7.x Version.
	1. Membership Operator
	2. NullCoalescing Operator
	3. Flagship Operators.
	

String Operator (Concatenation Operator)
1. Concatenation  2. Append Operation.

use to concate the values , together
we know that, PHP nature is Dynamic, it will type caste int,values to string
for concatenation.

since this, concatenation will be performed on the string data types only
hence called as string Operators.

Difference B/w concate Operator
and Append Operator.

.= (String Assigment Operator)
once used, concate Operator

.= (String Assigment Operator)
mulitple times used, append Operator

wap in PHP to make user-defined string_repeat function which, repeat the string
n no of times

string_repeat('H',10);  ---> HHHHHHHHHH or
str_multiply('H',10); ----> HHHHHHHHHH

Array Operators :- 
[] --> Subscript Operator --> Index Operator ---> Key Operator

In order to declare the Array we can use [] subscript Operator.
We can few mathematical Operation to perform, Array Operation

1. Union of Array : + Operator
2. Slack Equality of Array (value Equality) : ==
3. Strict Equality of Array (value and type(order) Equality) or Indentity Operation: ===
4. Not Equal Array : !=
5. UnIdentical Array Operations. !==

1. Membership Operator : && --> and || ---> or ^ (xor) ---> xor
2. NullCoalescing Operator : ??
3. Flagship(space-sphip) Operators. (<=>)


Flow controls In PHP
********************
What is the flow controls  in Programming :-
Flow controls means how you program will execute in Primary Memory, at Runtime.

What is Normal Execution of the Program?

There are Two Approach of the Normal Execution of the program
1. Top to Bottom Approach:
	The Program will start from very first line of the program, and stop at last line 
	of the program then it is called normal execution of program in T-B Approach.
	
	How many ways we can control it:-
	1. Decision Control Block : it allows the user, to control the execution of specific
		line of code.
			1. Selection Block
			2. Conditional Block
			3. Nested Conditional Block
	2. Return Control Blocks
	3. Loop Control Blocks
	4. Jump Control Blocks
	
	Note :: statements : Line or peice of code inside the Block, and Structure wrapping
	those line of statement is called as Block.
	
2. Left to Right Program
	Whenever a an expression is solved, it will be solved, from left to Right by default.
	But if we want to control the normal execution, we can modify it to, right to left.
	This can be done by using Operators.
	Operators will utilise, Associativity and Precedence Order to achieve this.
	Eg 1:
	2+2+2-2 L-R (+,- Operator Associativity L->R)
	$x=2+2 R-L (= Operator Associativity R->L)
	
	Execution L->R
	echo "The Result = ".10+20;   Associativity L->R 
	^
	|----> L->R
	Error : non-numeric value encountered error, because (.) has highest Priority then +/- 	
	if we use () parenthesis. 
	Execution R->L
	echo "The Result = ".(10+20);
							^
					L<-R <--| 
	step :- echo " The Result = ".30;
				  ^
				  |----> L->R 
	
	


Selection Block : 
	Switch Block : 1. when we have, multiple cases, and we want to execute, a given case
					 then we go for, switch Blocks (statements).
				   
				   2. switch statement are considered to be best alternative, of else-if 
				   ladder.
				   
	Switch are of Two Types
		1. unchained switch.
		2. chained switch.
		
		
		General Syntax of Switch Block
		******************************
		
		switch(<Evaluated Expression>){
			case <value-1>:
					//statement 1
					....
					//statement n
				break;
				
			case <value-2>:
					//statement 1
					....
					//statement n
				break;
				
			case <value-n>:
					//statement 1
					....
					//statement n
				break;
				
		  default:
				//statement 1
				...
				//statement n
		  break;
		
		}
		
		
		Note : 	Expression ---> Evaluate ---> Result
		2>2  ---> true or false Invalid 
		This Expression should be equal to one of case.
		
How to check Type of Character values:-
PHP Provides ctype function from <ctype.h> header file.
********************************************************
Character =  type string and length 1 and Ascii value range Alphabets.

ctype_alnum — Check for alphanumeric character(s)
ctype_alpha — Check for alphabetic character(s)
ctype_cntrl — Check for control character(s)
ctype_digit — Check for numeric character(s)
ctype_graph — Check for any printable character(s) except space
ctype_lower — Check for lowercase character(s)
ctype_print — Check for printable character(s)
ctype_punct — Check for any printable character which is not whitespace or an alphanumeric character
ctype_space — Check for whitespace character(s)
ctype_upper — Check for uppercase character(s)
ctype_xdigit — Check for character(s) representing a hexadecimal digit
		
Chanining Effect in Switch:-
***************************
a switch statement without any break is called as unchained switch and this effect
is called as chaining effect.

Inorder, to break the chaining effect in, switch we use minimum one break, statement for each case block.

How to break the, chain in switch
1. break : break the switch execution.
2. exit : terminate the entire program.
3. return : it will return the execution from bottom to Top.
4. goto exit_label; it will take the execution of the program where ever we want.


What is order of execution of switch block with break statement
if condition = $x%2 having sample space = {0,1} and default at (n+1) position.

1) O(1)  correct
2) O(2)
3) O(3)
4) O(4)

What is order of execution of switch block without break statement
if condition = $x%2 having sample space = {0,1} and default at (n+1) position.

1) O(1)
2) O(2)
3) O(3)
4) O(4)
5) O(n) correct

What is max order of execution of switch block without break statement
if condition = $x%2 having sample space = {0,1} and default at (n+1) position.

1) O(1)
2) O(2)
3) O(3)  correct
4) O(4)
5) O(n)

What is min order of execution of switch block without break statement
if condition = $x%2 having sample space = {0,1} and default at (n+1) position.

1) O(1)
2) O(2) correct
3) O(3)
4) O(4)
5) O(n)		


Types of labels
1. empty label : <lable-name>:; it does not contain any, statement within, label block

2. container label : its a label block which will contain minimum one statement.
exit_label: 
printf("This is One statement");

Type of labelled blocks in switch
*********************************
1. case blocks
	1. inner case blocks
	2. outer case blocks
2. default blocks
	1. inner default blocks
	2. outer default blocks

	Note :: This Blocks definition is Optional
	Note :: This syntax is support in C langauge But PHP does not supported Outer Label Blocks but supports inner label blocks.
	
	The labelled block of switch allows only 256 cases as de-limiters(seperator) for 8 Bit Compiler
	similarly for n-bit total no of cases = 2^(n) Cases.
	
Note :: using Automatic Script for, Testing

Some times, In order to perform white box testing, for each and every project,
becomes very hactic, so we can build a autonomous bot script to execute the program according to test cases.

working with break in default case :-
************************************
if there are n no of cases then the actual position of default is at (n+1)th.
if default case is at (n+1)th condition in this case, break statement is 
optional,

if default case position is at any condition B/w (1-n) then break becomes 
mendatory, other wise, consecutive chaining effect will be seen.

Multiple Correct
*******************
what is order(n) in switch block for default case without break at position
B/w (1 to n)th.

a) 1th
b) 2th
c) nth (correct)
d) (n+1)th (correct)


Conditional Block : if we want to execute some line of code on the basis of some 
given condition, which is not hardcoded, then we must go for decision Block.

Note :: hardcoded  and softcoded
Harcoded
************
if($email=='ravi@gmail.com' and $password =='1234'){
	echo 'login success';
}else{
   echo 'Invalid user name or password';
}

Softcoded
************
if($email==$dbemail and $password ==$dbpassword){	
	echo 'login success';
}else{
   echo 'Invalid user name or password';
}

How to Apply Condition Block
*****************************
We can use decision control langauge construct or Keywords
1. if 
2. if-else 
3. else-if ladder 

1. syntax of if : 
*******************
	if(<Boolean-condition>){
		// execute this line only if above condition true
	}
	
	1. true ---> condition true ---> execution once 1 times.
	2. false ---> condition false ---> exection 0 times.
	3. '',null,false,0 all are treated as boolean false.
	all Other values will taken boolean false.
	
	
...Notes Suraj Class session...
Nested Conditions:-
1. One Block Inside another Blocks
This can take any form.

1.  Symmetical Nesting or Indentical Nesting.
	Block will be used for same Kind.
		1. if Block nested with If Blocks
		2. if else Block nested inside if else Block
		3. switch Block nested inside switch Block
		4. else-if ladder nested inside else-if Block 
	 
2. Un-symmetrical Nesting.
	This means One Block will be inside another, but will not belong to the same family.
	
	Prime Number Program using if-else 1 to 100
	How many primes are there in 1 to 100 : 25
	1 to 100
	2,3,5,7,11
	
Looping Statements:-
********************
How to looping statements
1.step 1: start from any infinite Loop
	for(;;)
	while(true)
2. step 2 : Add a Counter to start the condition
3. step 3: Add a If Block with Break to terminate the Condition.

	
How to convert Above Syntax For Loop
1. copy starting and Put in First Block of for
2. Copy the Modify Operator and put in last Block of for
3. copy the if Block of break statement Inverse condition and 
put the in middle Block

if($i>=100){
 	break;
}
	 
$i>=100 <----> $i<=100

1. if Loop has a body no need of semicolon

2. if loop does not have a body 
then semicolon is mendatory.
